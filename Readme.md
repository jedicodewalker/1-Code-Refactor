# Project Title Code-Refactor

Web accessibility is an increasingly important consideration for businesses, ensuring that people with disabilities or socio-economic restrictions have access to their website, and helping them avoid litigation. In this project I worked to refactor, or "cleanup" the code base so that it would comply with Web accessibility standards.


## Getting Started

In order to refactor the code the index.html needs to be part of the repo. The repo in question,  "1-CodeRefactor," needs to be cloned to your laptop and the index.html file will then be able to be worked on in your IDE of choice for refactoring. 

### Prerequisites

VScode or an IDE of your choice.
GitHub account
GitHub repository
GitBash on you local system

### Installing

Pull the repo 1-CodeRefactor to your local system perform a 

git pull https://github.com/jedicodewalker/1-Code-Refactor.git

open gitbash

cd Desktop\1-Code-Refactor\
from this directory, type the command "code ."

This will open vscode and the files from the 1-Code-Factor directory will be in VScode  ready for editing.

Edit code and then save the index.html file.

Puch the refactored files to the github repo 1-Code-Refactor.

from your gitbash console type the following commands:

git add -p index.html
git committ -m refactored code
git push

## Running the tests

In VScode add web accessability plugin. Once installed utilize it to determine where the code needs to be cleaned up.


## Deployment

In order to stand up this web page go into settings while in the 1-Code-Refactor repo and pull the link from GitHub pages.

The site is not deployed and can be reached from this link.
